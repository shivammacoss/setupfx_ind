        <h2>High-risk activity</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Trading forex, CFDs, cryptocurrencies, derivatives, and other leveraged products involves substantial risk of
            loss.
          </strong>{' '}
          You should not trade with money you cannot afford to lose. Leverage can amplify both gains and losses.

        <h2>3. Leverage &amp; margin</h2>
        <p>
          Using margin or leverage means you can lose more than your initial deposit in some products or under extreme
          conditions. Monitor margin requirements and stop-out levels at all times.
